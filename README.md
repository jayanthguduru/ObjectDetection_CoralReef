# ObjectDetection_CoralReef

The COTS outbreak can be a disaster for coral reefs, with these ravenous starfish capable of wiping out almost all the living corals. At their most impressive size, Crown-of- Thorns starfish are up to 80cm (31inch) in diameter - eaily noticeable among other inhabitants on the reef.The Great Barrier Reef Foundation established an innovation program to develop new survey and intervention methods to provide a step change in COTS Control. Underwater cameras will collect thousands of reef images and AI technology could drastically improve the efficiency and scale at which reef managers detect and control COTS outbreaks. To scale up video-based surveying systems, Australiaâ€™s national science agency, CSIRO has teamed up with Google to develop innovative machine learning technology that can analyse large image datasets accurately, efficiently, and in near real-time. (Zhang et al. 2021) I have used many augmentation techniques in this project along with YOLO objection detection system. You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.
